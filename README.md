# Prediction of Product Sales
This report comprises two sections: Part 1 for data exploration and Part 2 for machine learning modeling of food item sales. The goal is to help the retailer better understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.

## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the data visualization was performed.
Some key visualizations are shown as follows:

- This histogram shows that the majority of outlet sales are below $4,000.

- This countplot shows the types of food ranked from most popular to least popular in terms of sales quantity.
  
## Machine learning models and analysis
The finely tuned Random Forest model yielded our best results, as evidenced by the following metrics:

- With this model, the error in predicting product sales is expected to fall within a range of Â±$1,048.798. However, it's important to note that this model is not perfect, as indicated by an R-squared value of approximately 0.6.
- It is recommended to explore additional models to potentially improve predictive accuracy.

The random forest permutation importances had the following features as important: Item_MRP, Outlet_Type_Grocery Store, Outlet_Identifier_OUT027, Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3, Outlet_Establishment_Year
